A Security\n  Analysis","summary":"  Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging\nresearch shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to\nstandalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same\nsafety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the\ngreater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may\nexpose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold\nthat addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors\nthat contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this\ndisparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and\nstandalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple\nevaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular,\nsystematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we\nidentify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI\nagents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action\ngeneration, and (3) observational capabilities.

KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies.

The\nKnowledge Neuron (KN) thesis is a prominent theory for explaining these\nmechanisms. This theory is based on the Knowledge Localization (KL) assumption,\nwhich suggests that a fact can be localized to a few knowledge storage units,\nnamely knowledge neurons.\n  However, this assumption has two limitations: first, it may be too rigid\nregarding knowledge storage, and second, it neglects the role of the attention\nmodule in knowledge expression.\n  In this paper, we first re-examine the KL assumption and demonstrate that its\nlimitations do indeed exist. To address these, we then present two new\nfindings, each targeting one of the limitations: one focusing on knowledge\nstorage and the other on knowledge expression.

As the idiom \"A picture is worth a thousand words\"\nimplies, representing a single image in current LVLMs can require hundreds or\neven thousands of tokens. This results in significant computational costs,\nwhich grow quadratically as input image resolution increases, thereby severely\nimpacting the efficiency of both training and inference. Previous approaches\nhave attempted to reduce the number of image tokens either before or within the\nearly layers of LVLMs. However, these strategies inevitably result in the loss\nof crucial image information, ultimately diminishing model performance. To\naddress this challenge, we conduct an empirical study revealing that all visual\ntokens are necessary for LVLMs in the shallow layers, and token redundancy\nprogressively increases in the deeper layers of the model. To this end, we\npropose PyramidDrop, a visual redundancy reduction strategy for LVLMs to boost\ntheir efficiency in both training and inference with neglectable performance\nloss. Specifically, we partition the LVLM into several stages and drop part of\nthe image tokens at the end of each stage with a pre-defined ratio, creating\npyramid-like visual tokens across model layers.

To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive\nstudy of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key\ndesign principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid\ninitial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best\nformulated as a function of centered reward.

In this paper, we introduce a\nframework to address this challenge, ConfLVLM, which is grounded on conformal\nprediction to achieve finite-sample distribution-free statistical guarantees on\nthe factuality of LVLM output. This framework treats an LVLM as a hypothesis\ngenerator, where each generated text detail (or claim) is considered an\nindividual hypothesis. It then applies a statistical hypothesis testing\nprocedure to verify each claim using efficient heuristic uncertainty measures\nto filter out unreliable claims before returning any responses to users.

However, the\noptimal token definition for 2D image structures remains an open question.\nMoreover, AR models suffer from exposure bias, where teacher forcing during\ntraining leads to error accumulation at inference. In this paper, we propose\nxAR, a generalized AR framework that extends the notion of a token to an entity\nX, which can represent an individual patch token, a cell (a $k\\times k$\ngrouping of neighboring patches), a subsample (a non-local grouping of distant\npatches), a scale (coarse-to-fine resolution), or even a whole image.\nAdditionally, we reformulate discrete token classification as\n\\textbf{continuous entity regression}, leveraging flow-matching methods at each\nAR step. This approach conditions training on noisy entities instead of ground\ntruth tokens, leading to Noisy Context Learning, which effectively alleviates\nexposure bias.

The recent deformable Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a robust solution\nto represent real-world dynamic scenes. However, it often leads to heavily\nredundant Gaussians, attempting to fit every training view at various time\nsteps, leading to slower rendering speeds. Additionally, the attributes of\nGaussians in static areas are time-invariant, making it unnecessary to model\nevery Gaussian, which can cause jittering in static regions.

While many methods for\ngaze estimation exist, they rely heavily on data-hungry deep learning to\nachieve high performance. This reliance often forces practitioners to harvest\ntraining data from unverified public datasets, outsource model training, or\nrely on pre-trained models. However, such practices expose gaze estimation\nmodels to backdoor attacks. In such attacks, adversaries inject backdoor\ntriggers by poisoning the training data, creating a backdoor vulnerability: the\nmodel performs normally with benign inputs, but produces manipulated gaze\ndirections when a specific trigger is present. This compromises the security of\nmany gaze-based applications, such as causing the model to fail in tracking the\ndriver's attention. To date, there is no defense that addresses backdoor\nattacks on gaze estimation models. In response, we introduce SecureGaze, the\nfirst solution designed to protect gaze estimation models from such attacks.\nUnlike classification models, defending gaze estimation poses unique challenges\ndue to its continuous output space and globally activated backdoor behavior. By\nidentifying distinctive characteristics of backdoored gaze estimation models,\nwe develop a novel and effective approach to reverse-engineer the trigger\nfunction for reliable backdoor detection. Extensive evaluations in both digital\nand physical worlds demonstrate that SecureGaze effectively counters a range of\nbackdoor attacks and outperforms seven state-of-the-art defenses adapted from\nclassification models.\n","authors":["Lingyu Du","Yupei Liu","Jinyuan Jia","Guohao Lan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20306v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20301v1","updated":"2025-02-27T17:29:46Z","published":"2025-02-27T17:29:46Z","title":"M^3Builder: A Multi-Agent System for Automated Machine Learning in\n  Medical Imaging","summary":"  Agentic AI systems have gained significant attention for their ability to\nautonomously perform complex tasks.

The goal of such\nresearch would be to train models capable of learning discriminative object\nembeddings that remain invariant to state changes while also staying invariant\nto transformations induced by changes in viewpoint, pose, illumination, etc. A\nmajor challenge in this regard is that instances of different objects (both\nwithin and across different categories) under various state changes may share\nsimilar visual characteristics and therefore may be close to one another in the\nlearned embedding space, which would make it more difficult to discriminate\nbetween them.

In this study, we aim to improve infection\ndetection by introducing Synthetic Caption Augmented Retrieval for Wound\nInfection Detection (SCARWID), a novel deep learning framework that leverages\nsynthetic textual descriptions to augment DFU images. SCARWID consists of two\ncomponents: (1) Wound-BLIP, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) fine-tuned on\nGPT-4o-generated descriptions to synthesize consistent captions from images;\nand (2) an Image-Text Fusion module that uses cross-attention to extract\ncross-modal embeddings from an image and its corresponding Wound-BLIP caption.\nInfection status is determined by retrieving the top-k similar items from a\nlabeled support set.

However, a fundamental limitation is that their\nsampling process is slow due to a need for many (e.g., 2000) iterations of\nsequential computations. An intuitive acceleration method is to reduce the\nsampling iterations which however causes severe performance degradation. We\nassault this problem to the ill-conditioned issues of the Langevin dynamics and\nreverse diffusion in the sampling process. Under this insight, we propose a\nnovel preconditioned diffusion sampling (PDS) method that leverages matrix\npreconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. PDS alters the\nsampling process of a vanilla SGM at marginal extra computation cost and\nwithout model retraining. Theoretically, we prove that PDS preserves the output\ndistribution of the SGM, with no risk of inducing systematical bias to the\noriginal sampling process. We further theoretically reveal a relation between\nthe parameter of PDS and the sampling iterations, easing the parameter\nestimation under varying sampling iterations. Extensive experiments on various\nimage datasets with a variety of resolutions and diversity validate that our\nPDS consistently accelerates off-the-shelf SGMs whilst maintaining the\nsynthesis quality. In particular, PDS can accelerate by up to 28x on more\nchallenging high-resolution (1024x1024) image generation. Compared with the\nlatest generative models (e.g., CLD-SGM and Analytic-DDIM), PDS can achieve the\nbest sampling quality on CIFAR-10 at an FID score of 1.99.

However, recent efforts in ConvNet designs primarily focused on\nincreasing kernel size to obtain a larger receptive field without considering\nthis crucial biomimetic mechanism to further improve performance. To this end,\nwe propose a novel pure ConvNet vision backbone, termed OverLoCK, which is\ncarefully devised from both the architecture and mixer perspectives.\nSpecifically, we introduce a biomimetic Deep-stage Decomposition Strategy (DDS)\nthat fuses semantically meaningful context representations into middle and deep\nlayers by providing dynamic top-down context guidance at both feature and\nkernel weight levels.

To achieve better detection performance, one type\nof approach proposes to fine-tune the model with auxiliary OOD datasets to\namplify the difference between ID and OOD data through a separation loss\ndefined on model outputs. However, none of these studies consider enlarging the\nfeature disparity, which should be more effective compared to outputs. The main\ndifficulty lies in the diversity of OOD samples, which makes it hard to\ndescribe their feature distribution, let alone design losses to separate them\nfrom ID features. In this paper, we neatly fence off the problem based on an\naggregation property of ID features named Neural Collapse (NC). NC means that\nthe penultimate features of ID samples within a class are nearly identical to\nthe last layer weight of the corresponding class.

However, the existing\ntrajectory-based approaches are usually limited to only generating the motion\ntrajectory of the controlled object and ignoring the dynamic interactions\nbetween the controlled object and its surroundings. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a Chain-of-Thought-based motion controller for controllable video\ngeneration, named C-Drag. Instead of directly generating the motion of some\nobjects, our C-Drag first performs object perception and then reasons the\ndynamic interactions between different objects according to the given motion\ncontrol of the objects. Specifically, our method includes an object perception\nmodule and a Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module. The object\nperception module employs visual language models to capture the position and\ncategory information of various objects within the image. The\nChain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module takes this information as input\nand conducts a stage-wise reasoning process to generate motion trajectories for\neach of the affected objects, which are subsequently fed to the diffusion model\nfor video synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a new video object interaction\n(VOI) dataset to evaluate the generation quality of motion controlled video\ngeneration methods. Our VOI dataset contains three typical types of\ninteractions and provides the motion trajectories of objects that can be used\nfor accurate performance evaluation.

In this work, we aim to delving into the limits of image enhancers\nboth from visual quality and computational efficiency, while striving for both\nbetter performance and faster processing. To be concrete, by rethinking the\ntask demands, we build an explicit connection, i.e., visual quality and\ncomputational efficiency are corresponding to model learning and structure\ndesign, respectively. Around this connection, we enlarge parameter space by\nintroducing the re-parameterization for ample model learning of a pre-defined\nminimalist network (e.g., just one layer), to avoid falling into a local\nsolution. To strengthen the structural representation, we define a hierarchical\nsearch scheme for discovering a task-oriented re-parameterized structure, which\nalso provides powerful support for efficiency.

Deep learning (DL) has proven to be an\neffective method for rapidly generating landslide inventories in large-scale\ndisaster areas. However, DL models rely heavily on high-quality labeled\nlandslide data for strong feature extraction capabilities. And landslide\ndetection using DL urgently needs a benchmark dataset to evaluate the\ngeneralization ability of the latest models. To solve the above problems, we\nconstruct a Large-scale Multi-source High-resolution Landslide Dataset (LMHLD)\nfor Landslide Detection based on DL. LMHLD collects remote sensing images from\nfive different satellite sensors across seven study areas worldwide: Wenchuan,\nChina (2008); Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2011); Gorkha, Nepal (2015); Jiuzhaigou,\nChina (2015); Taiwan, China (2018); Hokkaido, Japan (2018); Emilia-Romagna,\nItaly (2023). The dataset includes a total of 25,365 patches, with different\npatch sizes to accommodate different landslide scales. Additionally, a training\nmodule, LMHLDpart, is designed to accommodate landslide detection tasks at\nvarying scales and to alleviate the issue of catastrophic forgetting in\nmulti-task learning. Furthermore, the models trained by LMHLD is applied in\nother datasets to highlight the robustness of LMHLD. Five dataset quality\nevaluation experiments designed by using seven DL models from the U-Net family\ndemonstrate that LMHLD has the potential to become a benchmark dataset for\nlandslide detection.

Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning,\nand test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs\nperformance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various\nreal-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of\npost-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond\npretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward\nhacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in\nmodel alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline\nfuture research directions. We also provide a public repository to continually\ntrack developments in this fast-evolving field:\nhttps://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Awesome-LLM-Post-training.\n","authors":["Komal Kumar","Tajamul Ashraf","Omkar Thawakar","Rao Muhammad Anwer","Hisham Cholakkal","Mubarak Shah","Ming-Hsuan Yang","Phillip H.

Recent persuasive dialogue datasets often fail to align with\nreal-world interpersonal interactions, leading to unfaithful representations.\nFor instance, unrealistic scenarios may arise, such as when the persuadee\nexplicitly instructs the persuader on which persuasion strategies to employ,\nwith each of the persuadee's questions corresponding to a specific strategy for\nthe persuader to follow. This issue can be attributed to a violation of the\n\"Double Blind\" condition, where critical information is fully shared between\nparticipants. In actual human interactions, however, key information such as\nthe mental state of the persuadee and the persuasion strategies of the\npersuader is not directly accessible. The persuader must infer the persuadee's\nmental state using Theory of Mind capabilities and construct arguments that\nalign with the persuadee's motivations. To address this gap, we introduce\nToMMA, a novel multi-agent framework for dialogue generation that is guided by\ncausal Theory of Mind. This framework ensures that information remains\nundisclosed between agents, preserving \"double-blind\" conditions, while causal\nToM directs the persuader's reasoning, enhancing alignment with human-like\npersuasion dynamics.

A predominant\nsource of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt\nthe learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint\nrecovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper\npresents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM\ntraining, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and\ndatasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to $1000\\times$ larger\nthan typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To\naddress this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a\nnovel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset\nand spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both\npre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam\nand its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M\nto 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time\nSeries Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by\nenabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained\nand updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini.

To mitigate this gap, we\npropose PersuasiveToM, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ToM abilities of\nLLMs in persuasive dialogues. Our framework introduces two categories of\nquestions: (1) ToM Reasoning, assessing the capacity of LLMs to track evolving\nmental states (e.g., desire shifts in persuadees), and (2) ToM Application,\nevaluating whether LLMs can take advantage of inferred mental states to select\neffective persuasion strategies (e.g., emphasize rarity) and evaluate the\neffectiveness of persuasion strategies.

While\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) considerably reduces the training memory\nassociated with parameters, it does not address the significant computational\ncosts and activation memory. In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward\nPropagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs\nand activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers\nduring backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training\nshallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections.\nAdditionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an\nappropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not\nonly applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated\nwith all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation.\nSpecifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy\nto the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5x, and\nenable training with a sequence length 6.2x larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU.\nFurthermore, our DropBP enabled a throughput increase of 79% on a NVIDIA A100\nGPU and 117% on an Intel Gaudi2 HPU.

Drawing on identifiability in\nstatistics, where parameters are uniquely inferred under specific assumptions,\nwe explore the identifiability of MI explanations.\n  We identify two main MI strategies: (1) \"where-then-what,\" which isolates a\ncircuit replicating model behavior before interpreting it, and (2)\n\"what-then-where,\" which starts with candidate algorithms and searches for\nneural activation subspaces implementing them, using causal alignment.\n  We test both strategies on Boolean functions and small multi-layer\nperceptrons, fully enumerating candidate explanations. Our experiments reveal\nsystematic non-identifiability: multiple circuits can replicate behavior, a\ncircuit can have multiple interpretations, several algorithms can align with\nthe network, and one algorithm can align with different subspaces.\n  Is uniqueness necessary? A pragmatic approach may require only predictive and\nmanipulability standards. If uniqueness is essential for understanding,\nstricter criteria may be needed. We also reference the inner interpretability\nframework, which validates explanations through multiple criteria. This work\ncontributes to defining explanation standards in AI.\n","authors":["Maxime Méloux","Silviu Maniu","François Portet","Maxime Peyrard"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20914v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20898v1","updated":"2025-02-28T09:54:13Z","published":"2025-02-28T09:54:13Z","title":"A database to support the evaluation of gender biases in GPT-4o output","summary":"  The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) involves ethical\nrisks for users and societies.

We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs such as\nDeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices\nhaving only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while non-triangular\nmatrices are needed to count modulo $3$.

We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a\ncomprehensive profile schema. Then, we refine the simulation through\nconditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle\nconsistency, optimizing it at both the utterance and conversation levels.\nFinally, we adopt a diverse profile sampler to capture the distribution of\nreal-world user profiles.

The benefit and detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a\nblack box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so\nexisting methods are data-driven, need additional utility evaluators or\npost-hoc. This paper takes the first step towards providing a theory to explain\nand trade off the benefit and detriment in RAG.

Personalized food recommendations\ncan help address these challenges by tailoring meal plans to individual\npreferences, habits, and dietary restrictions. However, existing dietary\nrecommendation systems often lack adaptability, fail to consider real-world\nconstraints such as food ingredient availability, and require extensive user\ninput, making them impractical for sustainable and scalable daily use.

While previous studies\npoint out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nshow that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\nare overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we\nreveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in\ntheir own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence\nand demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nexhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual\nquality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants:\nPPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated\nReward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model\ntraining, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment\nbetween response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward\nscore during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the\nexponential average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly\nintegrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden\nlabels.

With strong language processing\ncapabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have\nbecome popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far,\nLLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which\nrestricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given\nthese restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal\nfor LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals\nrelevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full\npotential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose\nin-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in\nattention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient\nre-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration\nmethod using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only\nrequires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it\nsubstantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at\nleast $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to\nany LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking.\nExtensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop\nand multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms\nRankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice.

Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade\nperformance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the\nlargest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies\nfrom 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a\nfully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our\nfindings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While\nFMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged\nwith - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled\ntraining data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training\nmarkedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging\nmorphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs\nused up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their\nsustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages\nfor rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for\nclinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical\napplications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training\nremain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs\nand end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology\nsolutions fit for clinical use.\n","authors":["Nita Mulliqi","Anders Blilie","Xiaoyi Ji","Kelvin Szolnoky","Henrik Olsson","Sol Erika Boman","Matteo Titus","Geraldine Martinez Gonzalez","Julia Anna Mielcarz","Masi Valkonen","Einar Gudlaugsson","Svein R.

Recently, text-guided\ndiffusion models have gained significant attention due to their ability to\ngenerate highly diverse and high-quality images based on text prompts in\nnatural image synthesis. Motivated by this, this paper proposes\nTxt2HSI-LDM(VAE), a novel language-informed hyperspectral image synthesis\nmethod to address the ISSD in HSIC. The proposed approach uses a denoising\ndiffusion model, which iteratively removes Gaussian noise to generate\nhyperspectral samples conditioned on textual descriptions. First, to address\nthe high-dimensionality of hyperspectral data, a universal variational\nautoencoder (VAE) is designed to map the data into a low-dimensional latent\nspace, which provides stable features and reduces the inference complexity of\ndiffusion model. Second, a semi-supervised diffusion model is designed to fully\ntake advantage of unlabeled data. Random polygon spatial clipping (RPSC) and\nuncertainty estimation of latent feature (LF-UE) are used to simulate the\nvarying degrees of mixing. Third, the VAE decodes HSI from latent space\ngenerated by the diffusion model with the language conditions as input.

A key factor\ncontributing to their effectiveness is the high quantity and quality of data\nused during training. However, mainstream DMs now consume increasingly large\namounts of data. For example, training a Stable Diffusion model requires\nbillions of image-text pairs. This enormous data requirement poses significant\nchallenges for training large DMs due to high data acquisition costs and\nstorage expenses. To alleviate this data burden, we propose a novel scenario:\nusing existing DMs as data sources to train new DMs with any architecture. We\nrefer to this scenario as Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models\n(DKDM), where the generative ability of DMs is transferred to new ones in a\ndata-free manner. To tackle this challenge, we make two main contributions.\nFirst, we introduce a DKDM objective that enables the training of new DMs via\ndistillation, without requiring access to the data. Second, we develop a\ndynamic iterative distillation method that efficiently extracts time-domain\nknowledge from existing DMs, enabling direct retrieval of training data without\nthe need for a prolonged generative process. To the best of our knowledge, we\nare the first to explore this scenario.

However, it typically relies on large amounts of\nhuman demonstration data, which limits its scalability and applicability in\ndynamic, real-world environments. One key challenge in this context is object\ngeneralization, where a robot trained to perform a task with one object, such\nas \"hand over the apple,\" struggles to transfer its skills to a semantically\nsimilar but visually different object, such as \"hand over the peach.\" This gap\nin generalization to new objects beyond those in the same category has yet to\nbe adequately addressed in previous work on end-to-end visuomotor policy\nlearning. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for\nachieving object generalization through Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models,\nreferred to as \\textbf{ObjectVLA}. Our model enables robots to generalize\nlearned skills to novel objects without requiring explicit human demonstrations\nfor each new target object.

However, recent research on utilizing event data has\nprimarily focused on low-light image enhancement, neglecting image enhancement\nand brightness adjustment across a broader range of lighting conditions, such\nas normal or high illumination. Based on this, we propose a novel research\nquestion: how to employ events to enhance and adaptively adjust the brightness\nof images captured under broad lighting conditions?

A growing number of reports have indicated\nthat deep neural networks (DNNs) become capable of analyzing 3D scenes after\ntraining on large image datasets. We investigated if this emergent ability for\n3D analysis in DNNs is sufficient for VPT with the 3D perception challenge\n(3D-PC): a novel benchmark for 3D perception in humans and DNNs. The 3D-PC is\ncomprised of three 3D-analysis tasks posed within natural scene images: 1. a\nsimple test of object depth order, 2. a basic VPT task (VPT-basic), and 3.\nanother version of VPT (VPT-Strategy) designed to limit the effectiveness of\n\"shortcut\" visual strategies. We tested human participants (N=33) and linearly\nprobed or text-prompted over 300 DNNs on the challenge and found that nearly\nall of the DNNs approached or exceeded human accuracy in analyzing object depth\norder. Surprisingly, DNN accuracy on this task correlated with their object\nrecognition performance. In contrast, there was an extraordinary gap between\nDNNs and humans on VPT-basic. Humans were nearly perfect, whereas most DNNs\nwere near chance. Fine-tuning DNNs on VPT-basic brought them close to human\nperformance, but they, unlike humans, dropped back to chance when tested on\nVPT-Strategy. Our challenge demonstrates that the training routines and\narchitectures of today's DNNs are well-suited for learning basic 3D properties\nof scenes and objects but are ill-suited for reasoning about these properties\nas humans do.

The limited class diversity inherent to\none-class classification tasks, combined with distribution biases caused by\nvariations in products across and within clients, poses significant challenges\nfor preserving data privacy with federated UAD. Thus, this article proposes an\nefficient federated learning method with dynamic memory and memory-reduce for\nunsupervised image anomaly detection, called FedDyMem. Considering all client\ndata belongs to a single class (i.e., normal sample) in UAD and the\ndistribution of intra-class features demonstrates significant skewness,\nFedDyMem facilitates knowledge sharing between the client and server through\nthe client's dynamic memory bank instead of model parameters. In the local\nclients, a memory generator and a metric loss are employed to improve the\nconsistency of the feature distribution for normal samples, leveraging the\nlocal model to update the memory bank dynamically. For efficient communication,\na memory-reduce method based on weighted averages is proposed to significantly\ndecrease the scale of memory banks.

These methods face\nsignificant challenges, especially the information bottleneck, when they are\napplied to high-resolution HD data. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces\nMagNet, a multi-level attention graph network designed for accurate prediction\nof high-resolution HD data.

In particular,\n\\textit{(i)} fine-tuning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where\nimprovements on a target domain degrade generalization on other tasks, and\n\\textit{(ii)} merging fine-tuned checkpoints from disparate tasks can lead to\nsignificant performance loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LiNeS,\nLayer-increasing Network Scaling, a post-training editing technique designed to\npreserve pre-trained generalization while enhancing fine-tuned task\nperformance. LiNeS scales parameter updates linearly based on their layer depth\nwithin the network, maintaining shallow layers close to their pre-trained\nvalues to preserve general features while allowing deeper layers to retain\ntask-specific representations. In multi-task model merging scenarios,\nlayer-wise scaling of merged parameters reduces negative task interference.\nLiNeS demonstrates significant improvements in both single-task and multi-task\nsettings across various benchmarks in vision and natural language processing.\nIt mitigates forgetting, enhances out-of-distribution generalization,\nintegrates seamlessly with existing multi-task model merging baselines\nimproving their performance across benchmarks and model sizes, and can boost\ngeneralization when merging LLM policies aligned with different rewards via\nRLHF.

However, a fundamental limitation is that their\nsampling process is slow due to a need for many (e.g., 2000) iterations of\nsequential computations. An intuitive acceleration method is to reduce the\nsampling iterations which however causes severe performance degradation. We\nassault this problem to the ill-conditioned issues of the Langevin dynamics and\nreverse diffusion in the sampling process. Under this insight, we propose a\nnovel preconditioned diffusion sampling (PDS) method that leverages matrix\npreconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. PDS alters the\nsampling process of a vanilla SGM at marginal extra computation cost and\nwithout model retraining. Theoretically, we prove that PDS preserves the output\ndistribution of the SGM, with no risk of inducing systematical bias to the\noriginal sampling process. We further theoretically reveal a relation between\nthe parameter of PDS and the sampling iterations, easing the parameter\nestimation under varying sampling iterations. Extensive experiments on various\nimage datasets with a variety of resolutions and diversity validate that our\nPDS consistently accelerates off-the-shelf SGMs whilst maintaining the\nsynthesis quality. In particular, PDS can accelerate by up to 28x on more\nchallenging high-resolution (1024x1024) image generation. Compared with the\nlatest generative models (e.g., CLD-SGM and Analytic-DDIM), PDS can achieve the\nbest sampling quality on CIFAR-10 at an FID score of 1.99.

This reformulation allows us to model the joint\ndistribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the\nsame instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on\nhindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables\nand generate counterfactuals of observed strings.

When the expectation and variance of failure counts are both\nfinite, it signals the ability to consistently find solutions to new\nchallenges, which we define as the Autonomous Level of intelligence. Using\nSurvival Game, we comprehensively evaluate existing AI systems. Our results\nshow that while AI systems achieve the Autonomous Level in simple tasks, they\nare still far from it in more complex tasks, such as vision, search,\nrecommendation, and language. While scaling current AI technologies might help,\nthis would come at an astronomical cost. Projections suggest that achieving the\nAutonomous Level for general tasks would require $10^{26}$ parameters. To put\nthis into perspective, loading such a massive model requires so many H100 GPUs\nthat their total value is $10^{7}$ times that of Apple Inc.'s market value.\nEven with Moore's Law, supporting such a parameter scale would take $70$ years.\nThis staggering cost highlights the complexity of human tasks and the\ninadequacies of current AI technologies. To further investigate this\nphenomenon, we conduct a theoretical analysis of Survival Game and its\nexperimental results. Our findings suggest that human tasks possess a\ncriticality property. As a result, Autonomous Level requires a deep\nunderstanding of the task's underlying mechanisms. Current AI systems, however,\ndo not fully grasp these mechanisms and instead rely on superficial mimicry,\nmaking it difficult for them to reach an autonomous level. We believe Survival\nGame can not only guide the future development of AI but also offer profound\ninsights into human intelligence.\n","authors":["Jingtao Zhan","Jiahao Zhao","Jiayu Li","Yiqun Liu","Bo Zhang","Qingyao Ai","Jiaxin Mao","Hongning Wang","Min Zhang","Shaoping Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18858v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07596v2","updated":"2025-03-03T13:27:01Z","published":"2025-01-10T01:42:43Z","title":"Optimize Incompatible Parameters through Compatibility-aware Knowledge\n  Integration","summary":"  Deep neural networks have become foundational to advancements in multiple\ndomains, including recommendation systems, natural language processing, and so\non.

Despite its\neffectiveness, BoN is computationally expensive; it reduces sampling throughput\nby a factor of N. To make BoN more efficient at inference time, one strategy is\nto fine-tune the language model to mimic what BoN does during inference. To\nachieve this, we derive the distribution induced by the BoN algorithm. We then\npropose to fine-tune the language model to minimize backward KL divergence to\nthe BoN distribution.

With DailyDilemmas, we\nevaluate LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will choose and\nthe values represented by these action choices. Then, we analyze values through\nthe lens of five theoretical frameworks inspired by sociology, psychology, and\nphilosophy, including the World Values Survey, Moral Foundations Theory,\nMaslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik's Wheel of\nEmotions. For instance, we find LLMs are most aligned with self-expression over\nsurvival in World Values Survey and care over loyalty in Moral Foundations\nTheory. Interestingly, we find substantial preference differences in models for\nsome core values. For example, for truthfulness, Mixtral-8x7B neglects it by\n9.7% while GPT-4-turbo selects it by 9.4%. We also study the recent guidance\nreleased by OpenAI (ModelSpec), and Anthropic (Constitutional AI) to understand\nhow their designated principles reflect their models' actual value\nprioritization when facing nuanced moral reasoning in daily-life settings.\nFinally, we find that end users cannot effectively steer such prioritization\nusing system prompts.\n","authors":["Yu Ying Chiu","Liwei Jiang","Yejin Choi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02683v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted into ICLR 2025 (spotlight)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02497v2","updated":"2025-03-03T07:16:16Z","published":"2025-01-05T10:24:20Z","title":"Test-Time Compute: from System-1 Thinking to System-2 Thinking","summary":"  The remarkable performance of the o1 model in complex reasoning demonstrates\nthat test-time compute scaling can further unlock the model's potential,\nenabling powerful System-2 thinking.

Recent\nprogress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new\npossibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often\nsuffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses.\nFine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to\naddress these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution\nshifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of\nfine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing\nRAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains\nand can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and\nbetween the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile\nmultimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of\nMed-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an\nadaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based\npreference fine-tuning strategy.

Choosing how sensitive the model is to\nits context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at\ntasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this\npaper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining\nwhether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To\nguide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In\nthis task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a\nquestion (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior\nor contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer\nfor both intents (either France or England). When fine-tuned on this task,\ninstruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it\nwith high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow\ndown which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear\ntime algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single\nlayer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge.\nInterestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find\nthat the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model\nbut also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally,\nwe show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly\nit separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace.\nThese results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses\nbetween context and prior knowledge, hinting at a simple fundamental mechanism\nthat controls this behavior.\n","authors":["Julian Minder","Kevin Du","Niklas Stoehr","Giovanni Monea","Chris Wendler","Robert West","Ryan Cotterell"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07404v2.pdf","comment":"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20854v2","updated":"2025-03-03T03:00:59Z","published":"2025-02-28T08:53:08Z","title":"A Pilot Empirical Study on When and How to Use Knowledge Graphs as\n  Retrieval Augmented Generation","summary":"  The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into the Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) framework has attracted significant interest, with early\nstudies showing promise in mitigating hallucinations and improving model\naccuracy.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention\nas a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from\nconstructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in\nresponses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data\nconstruction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We\nidentify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the\nconstructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by\nthe presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference\npolicy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically\nsummarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address\nhallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment\n(OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct\nhallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised\nresponses in an on-policy manner.

Investigating the adversarial robustness of embodied vision\nnavigation is crucial, especially given the threat of 3D physical attacks that\ncould pose risks to human safety. However, existing attack methods for embodied\nvision navigation often lack physical feasibility due to challenges in\ntransferring digital perturbations into the physical world. Moreover, current\nphysical attacks for object detection struggle to achieve both multi-view\neffectiveness and visual naturalness in navigation scenarios. To address this,\nwe propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching\nadversarial patches to objects, where both opacity and textures are learnable.\nSpecifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a\nmulti-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which\noptimizes the patch's texture based on feedback from the vision-based\nperception model used in navigation. To make the patch inconspicuous to human\nobservers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, in which\nopacity is fine-tuned after texture optimization. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our adversarial patches decrease the navigation success rate\nby an average of 22.39%, outperforming previous methods in practicality,\neffectiveness, and naturalness.

MIGE introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps\nfree-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space,\nintegrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion mechanism.\nThis unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two key\nadvantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: By leveraging shared visual and\nsemantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and\nvisual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based\nediting.

To\nmitigate this problem, we present an low-biased general annotated dataset\ngeneration framework (lbGen). Instead of expensive manual collection, we aim at\ndirectly generating low-biased images with category annotations. To achieve\nthis goal, we propose to leverage the advantage of a multimodal foundation\nmodel (e.g., CLIP), in terms of aligning images in an low-biased semantic space\ndefined by language.

An\nintuitive alternative is to repeat the diffusion distillation process with a\nfine-tuned teacher model, which produces good results but is cumbersome and\ncomputationally intensive; the distillation training usually requires magnitude\nhigher of training compute compared to fine-tuning for specific image styles.\nIn this paper, we present an algorithm named pairwise sample optimization\n(PSO), which enables the direct fine-tuning of an arbitrary timestep-distilled\ndiffusion model. PSO introduces additional reference images sampled from the\ncurrent time-step distilled model, and increases the relative likelihood margin\nbetween the training images and reference images. This enables the model to\nretain its few-step generation ability, while allowing for fine-tuning of its\noutput distribution.

For\nknowledge-intensive tasks, the increased compute is often allocated to\nincorporate more external knowledge. However, without effectively utilizing\nsuch knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance.\nIn this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented\ngeneration (RAG), exploring the combination of multiple strategies beyond\nsimply increasing the quantity of knowledge, including in-context learning and\niterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale\ntest-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation\nsteps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize\ncontextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG\nperformance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally\nconfigured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a\ngiven budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference\nparameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads\nto nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a\nrelationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on\nthis, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG\nperformance across different inference configurations. The model predicts\noptimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align\nclosely with the experimental results. By applying these optimal\nconfigurations, we demonstrate that scaling inference compute on long-context\nLLMs achieves up to 58.9% gains on benchmark datasets compared to standard RAG.\n","authors":["Zhenrui Yue","Honglei Zhuang","Aijun Bai","Kai Hui","Rolf Jagerman","Hansi Zeng","Zhen Qin","Dong Wang","Xuanhui Wang","Michael Bendersky"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04343v2.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14105v4","updated":"2025-03-02T18:24:29Z","published":"2024-05-23T02:14:17Z","title":"Distributed Speculative Inference (DSI): Speculation Parallelism for\n  Provably Faster Lossless Language Model Inference","summary":"  This paper introduces distributed speculative inference (DSI), a novel\ninference algorithm that is provably faster than speculative inference (SI)\n[leviathan2023, chen2023, miao2024, sun2025, timor2025] and standard\nautoregressive inference (non-SI).

In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal\nvision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while\npreserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision\ntokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early\nlayers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text\ntokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to\nfuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the\nextreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token.\nLLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the\nunderstanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient\nmanner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks\ndemonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token\ninstead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by\n77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over\n10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.\n","authors":["Shaolei Zhang","Qingkai Fang","Zhe Yang","Yang Feng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03895v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Textual\nreasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math,\nlogics, optimization, and searching, which is unlikely to be solved by simply\nscaling up the model and data size. The recently released OpenAI GPT Code\nInterpreter and multi-agent frameworks such as AutoGen have demonstrated\nremarkable proficiency of integrating code generation and execution to solve\ncomplex tasks using LLMs. However, based on our experiments on 7 existing\npopular methods for steering code/text generation in both single- and\nmulti-turn settings with 14 tasks and 6 types of LLMs (including the new\nO1-preview), currently there is no optimal method to correctly steer LLMs to\nwrite code when needed. We discover some interesting patterns on when models\nuse code vs. textual reasoning with the evolution to task complexity and model\nsizes, which even result in an astonishingly inverse scaling behavior.

This\nphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long\ncontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model\nquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of\nattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that\nattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small\nmodels. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM\npre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,\nloss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its\nemergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective\noptimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly\ncorrelated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we\nfind that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention\nscores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value\ncomputation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems\nfrom tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax\nnormalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention\nwith other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without\nnormalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

However, current neural\nspeech representations lack such structure, resulting in dense token sequences\nthat are costly to process. To bridge this gap, we propose a new model, Sylber,\nthat produces speech representations with clean and robust syllabic structure.\nSpecifically, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that\nbootstraps syllabic embeddings by distilling from its own initial unsupervised\nsyllabic segmentation. This results in a highly structured representation of\nspeech features, offering three key benefits: 1) a fast, linear-time syllable\nsegmentation algorithm, 2) efficient syllabic tokenization with an average of\n4.27 tokens per second, and 3) novel phonological units suited for efficient\nspoken language modeling. Our proposed segmentation method is highly robust and\ngeneralizes to out-of-domain data and unseen languages without any tuning. By\ntraining token-to-speech generative models, fully intelligible speech can be\nreconstructed from Sylber tokens with a significantly lower bitrate than\nbaseline SSL tokens. This suggests that our model effectively compresses speech\ninto a compact sequence of tokens with minimal information loss. Lastly, we\ndemonstrate that categorical perception-a linguistic phenomenon in speech\nperception-emerges naturally in Sylber, making the embedding space more\ncategorical and sparse than previous speech features and thus supporting the\nhigh efficiency of our tokenization. Together, we present a novel SSL approach\nfor representing speech as syllables, with significant potential for efficient\nspeech tokenization and spoken language modeling.\n","authors":["Cheol Jun Cho","Nicholas Lee","Akshat Gupta","Dhruv Agarwal","Ethan Chen","Alan W Black","Gopala K.

To effectively capture\ntask-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language\nmodel, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related\n$n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using\nthe Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks:\nmachine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding,\nand math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with\nthe strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while\nmodel performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual\nquestion answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine\ntranslation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more\nnovel outputs.

We can train BCM\nfrom scratch or tune it using a pretrained consistency model, which reduces the\ntraining cost and increases scalability. We demonstrate that BCM enables\none-step generation and inversion while also allowing the use of additional\nsteps to enhance generation quality or reduce reconstruction error.

In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal\nvision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while\npreserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision\ntokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early\nlayers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text\ntokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to\nfuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the\nextreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token.\nLLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the\nunderstanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient\nmanner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks\ndemonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token\ninstead of 576.

Existing methods typically utilize generative\nmodels to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture\nmodifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a\ncharacter's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control\nover the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to\nprecisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region\nand the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of\ncontrol points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing.\nDYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to\nestablish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming\nsuboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired\nediting regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion\nModel into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling\nflexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing.

In this\npaper, we propose PureDiffusion, a dual-purpose framework that simultaneously\nserves two contrasting roles: backdoor defense and backdoor attack\namplification. For defense, we introduce two novel loss functions to invert\nbackdoor triggers embedded in diffusion models. The first leverages\ntrigger-induced distribution shifts across multiple timesteps of the diffusion\nprocess, while the second exploits the denoising consistency effect when a\nbackdoor is activated. Once an accurate trigger inversion is achieved, we\ndevelop a backdoor detection method that analyzes both the inverted trigger and\nthe generated backdoor targets to identify backdoor attacks.

Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond\nto streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time\nsetting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial\nconstraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional\nchallenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text\ndescriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene\ngeometry.

Furthermore, we establish the GrokLST project, a\ncomprehensive open-source ecosystem featuring the GrokLST dataset, a\nhigh-resolution benchmark, and the GrokLST toolkit, an open-source\nPyTorch-based toolkit encapsulating MoCoLSK alongside 40+ state-of-the-art\napproaches.

However, as text\ninputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and\naligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle\nthese issues, we propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding\nmethod for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization\nmethod for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts\nare divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method\novercomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For\npreference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to\nfine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference\nmodels for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that\nthe preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant\npart that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other\nvisual aspects of human preference.

A critical attribute of\nwatermark techniques is their robustness against various manipulations. In this\npaper, we introduce a watermark removal approach capable of effectively\nnullifying state-of-the-art watermarking techniques. Our primary insight\ninvolves regenerating the watermarked image starting from a clean Gaussian\nnoise via a controllable diffusion model, utilizing the extracted semantic and\nspatial features from the watermarked image. The semantic control adapter and\nthe spatial control network are specifically trained to control the denoising\nprocess towards ensuring image quality and enhancing consistency between the\ncleaned image and the original watermarked image. To achieve a smooth trade-off\nbetween watermark removal performance and image consistency, we further propose\nan adjustable and controllable regeneration scheme. This scheme adds varying\nnumbers of noise steps to the latent representation of the watermarked image,\nfollowed by a controlled denoising process starting from this noisy latent\nrepresentation. As the number of noise steps increases, the latent\nrepresentation progressively approaches clean Gaussian noise, facilitating the\ndesired trade-off. We apply our watermark removal methods across various\nwatermarking techniques, and the results demonstrate that our methods offer\nsuperior visual consistency/quality and enhanced watermark removal performance\ncompared to existing regeneration approaches.

One major\ncause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of an instruction hierarchy. Modern\nLLM architectures treat all inputs equally, failing to distinguish between and\nprioritize various types of instructions, such as system messages, user\nprompts, and data. As a result, lower-priority user prompts may override more\ncritical system instructions, including safety protocols. Existing approaches\nto achieving instruction hierarchy, such as delimiters and instruction-based\ntraining, do not address this issue at the architectural level. We introduce\nthe Instructional Segment Embedding (ISE) technique, inspired by BERT, to\nmodern large language models, which embeds instruction priority information\ndirectly into the model. This approach enables models to explicitly\ndifferentiate and prioritize various instruction types, significantly improving\nsafety against malicious prompts that attempt to override priority rules. Our\nexperiments on the Structured Query and Instruction Hierarchy benchmarks\ndemonstrate an average robust accuracy increase of up to 15.75% and 18.68%,\nrespectively.

However, superior short-context LLMs may\nunderperform in long-context scenarios due to insufficient long-context\nalignment.

To address these challenges, we introduce\nLongPO, that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to excel on long-context\ntasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities. LongPO harnesses\nLLMs to learn from self-generated short-to-long preference data, comprising\npaired responses generated for identical instructions with long-context inputs\nand their compressed short-context counterparts, respectively. This preference\nreveals capabilities and potentials of LLMs cultivated during short-context\nalignment that may be diminished in under-aligned long-context scenarios.\nAdditionally, LongPO incorporates a short-to-long KL constraint to mitigate\nshort-context performance decline during long-context alignment. When applied\nto Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from 128K to 512K context lengths, LongPO fully\nretains short-context performance and largely outperforms naive SFT and DPO in\nboth long- and short-context tasks.

However, their\nperformance notably degrades when trained with insufficient data due to lack of\ninherent inductive biases. Distilling knowledge and inductive biases from a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) teacher has emerged as an effective strategy\nfor enhancing the generalization of ViTs on limited datasets. Previous\napproaches to Knowledge Distillation (KD) have pursued two primary paths: some\nfocused solely on distilling the logit distribution from CNN teacher to ViT\nstudent, neglecting the rich semantic information present in intermediate\nfeatures due to the structural differences between them. Others integrated\nfeature distillation along with logit distillation, yet this introduced\nalignment operations that limits the amount of knowledge transferred due to\nmismatched architectures and increased the computational overhead. To this end,\nthis paper presents Hybrid Data-efficient Knowledge Distillation (HDKD)\nparadigm which employs a CNN teacher and a hybrid student. The choice of hybrid\nstudent serves two main aspects. First, it leverages the strengths of both\nconvolutions and transformers while sharing the convolutional structure with\nthe teacher model. Second, this shared structure enables the direct application\nof feature distillation without any information loss or additional\ncomputational overhead. Additionally, we propose an efficient light-weight\nconvolutional block named Mobile Channel-Spatial Attention (MBCSA), which\nserves as the primary convolutional block in both teacher and student models.\nExtensive experiments on two medical public datasets showcase the superiority\nof HDKD over other state-of-the-art models and its computational efficiency.\nSource code at: https://github.com/omarsherif200/HDKD\n","authors":["Omar S.

Each ODE resembles the ODE that\nis solved in a classic rectified flow, but differs in its domain, i.e.,\nlocation, velocity, acceleration, etc. Unlike the classic rectified flow\nformulation, which formulates a single ODE in the location domain and only\ncaptures the expected velocity field (sufficient to capture a multi-modal data\ndistribution), the hierarchical rectified flow formulation models the\nmulti-modal random velocity field, acceleration field, etc., in their entirety.\nThis more faithful modeling of the random velocity field enables integration\npaths to intersect when the underlying ODE is solved during data generation.\nIntersecting paths in turn lead to integration trajectories that are more\nstraight than those obtained in the classic rectified flow formulation, where\nintegration paths cannot intersect.

Model distillation is commonly employed to reduce model\nsize while maintaining acceptable performance. However, distillation can be\ninefficient since it involves multiple training steps. In this work, we\nintroduce MODULARSTARENCODER, a modular multi-exit encoder with 1B parameters,\nuseful for multiple tasks within the scope of code retrieval.\nMODULARSTARENCODER is trained with a novel self-distillation mechanism that\nsignificantly improves lower-layer representations-allowing different portions\nof the model to be used while still maintaining a good trade-off in terms of\nperformance. Our architecture focuses on enhancing text-to-code and\ncode-to-code search by systematically capturing syntactic and semantic\nstructures across multiple levels of representation. Specific encoder layers\nare targeted as exit heads, allowing higher layers to guide earlier layers\nduring training. This self-distillation effect improves intermediate\nrepresentations, increasing retrieval recall at no extra training cost. In\naddition to the multi-exit scheme, our approach integrates a repository-level\ncontextual loss that maximally utilizes the training context window, further\nenhancing the learned representations.

There is a gap in predictive approaches,\nwhich we address in our study by enabling to predict the volume of abusive\nreplies a tweet will receive after being posted. We formulate the problem from\nthe perspective of a social media user asking: ``if I post a certain message on\nsocial media, is it possible to predict the volume of abusive replies it might\nreceive?'' We look at four types of features, namely text, text metadata, tweet\nmetadata, and account features, which also help us understand the extent to\nwhich the user or the content helps predict the number of abusive replies.\nThis, in turn, helps us develop a model to support social media users in\nfinding the best way to post content. One of our objectives is also to\ndetermine the extent to which the volume of abusive replies that a tweet will\nget are motivated by the content of the tweet or by the identity of the user\nposting it. Our study finds that one can build a model that performs\ncompetitively by developing a comprehensive set of features derived from the\ncontent of the message that is going to be posted.

The majority of current alignment methods rely on\nfine-tuning or prompting, which can be either costly or difficult to control.\nModel steering algorithms, which modify the model output by constructing\nspecific steering directions, are typically easy to implement and\noptimization-free. However, their capabilities are typically limited to\nsteering the model into one of the two directions (i.e., bidirectional\nsteering), and there has been no theoretical understanding to guarantee their\nperformance. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to understand and\nquantify the model steering methods. Inspired by the framework, we propose a\nconfident direction steering method (CONFST) that steers LLMs via modifying\ntheir activations at inference time. More specifically, CONFST builds a\nconfident direction that is closely aligned with users' preferences, and this\ndirection is then added to the activations of the LLMs to effectively steer the\nmodel output. Our approach offers three key advantages over popular\nbidirectional model steering methods: 1) It is more powerful, since multiple\n(i.e. more than two) users' preferences can be aligned simultaneously; 2) It is\nsimple to implement, since there is no need to determine which layer to add the\nsteering vector to; 3) No explicit user instruction is required.

Therefore, this paper\nproposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO. Incorporating sentence-level factuality as\nmask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the\npreferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not\npreferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly\nimprove the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and\nout-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics\nare unseen during training. Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of\nLlama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%,\neven surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its\nFactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29%\nto 39.39%.

In this\nwork, we introduce a large-scale human-collected dataset for measuring honesty\ndirectly, allowing us to disentangle accuracy from honesty for the first time.\nAcross a diverse set of LLMs, we find that while larger models obtain higher\naccuracy on our benchmark, they do not become more honest.

However, no universally accepted\nquantitative definition of tenseness has been established in any language.\nPrevious studies, including those by Jakobson, Fant, and Halle (1951) and\nChomsky and Halle (1968), have explored the relationship between vowel\ntenseness and the vocal tract. Building on these foundations, Ishizaki (2019,\n2022) proposed an indirect quantification of vowel tenseness using formant\nangles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_{F1}$ and their first and second derivatives,\n$d^Z_1(t)/dt = \\lim \\tan \\theta_1(t$) and $d^2 Z_1(t)/dt^2 = d/dt \\lim \\tan\n\\theta_1(t)$. This study extends this approach by investigating the potential\nrole of a force-related parameter in determining vowel quality. Specifically,\nwe introduce a simplified model based on the Lagrangian equation to describe\nthe dynamic interaction of the tongue and jaw within the oral cavity during the\narticulation of close vowels. This model provides a theoretical framework for\nestimating the forces involved in vowel production across different languages,\noffering new insights into the physical mechanisms underlying vowel\narticulation.

Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer\nfrom three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling\nnumerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous\ntemporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time\nexpert knowledge integration. We present SMETimes, the first systematic\ninvestigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series\nforecasting. Our approach centers on three key innovations: A\nstatistically-enhanced prompting mechanism that bridges numerical time series\nwith textual semantics through descriptive statistical features; A adaptive\nfusion embedding architecture that aligns temporal patterns with language model\ntoken spaces through learnable parameters; And a dynamic mixture-of-experts\nframework enabled by SLMs' computational efficiency, adaptively combining base\npredictions with domain-specific models. Extensive evaluations across seven\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our 3B-parameter SLM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on five primary datasets while maintaining 3.8x\nfaster training and 5.2x lower memory consumption compared to 7B-parameter LLM\nbaselines.

However, due to the\nimbalance in training data, their capabilities in non-English languages are\nlimited. Recent studies revealed the English-pivot multilingual mechanism of\nLLMs, where LLMs implicitly convert non-English queries into English ones at\nthe bottom layers and adopt English for thinking at the middle layers. However,\ndue to the absence of explicit supervision for cross-lingual alignment in the\nintermediate layers of LLMs, the internal representations during these stages\nmay become inaccurate. In this work, we introduce a deep supervision\nfine-tuning method (DFT) that incorporates additional supervision in the\ninternal layers of the model to guide its workflow. Specifically, we introduce\ntwo training objectives on different layers of LLMs: one at the bottom layers\nto constrain the conversion of the target language into English, and another at\nthe middle layers to constrain reasoning in English.

One theoretical weakness of\ntransformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential\ncomputation and state tracking (Merrill & Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are\nexplicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs). But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over\ntransformers) in expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the answer\nis no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is limited very\nsimilarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation outside the\ncomplexity class $\\mathsf{TC}^0$.

We base these steps on two\nfindings. First, we can replace an LLM's softmax attentions with\nclosely-approximating linear attentions, simply by training the linear\nattentions to match their softmax counterparts with an output MSE loss\n(\"attention transfer\"). Then, this enables adjusting for approximation errors\nand recovering LLM quality simply with low-rank adaptation (LoRA).

While recent efforts have applied\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in\nfederated settings, they typically use single or multiple independent low-rank\nadapters with predefined maximal and minimal ranks, which may not be optimal\nfor diverse data sources over clients.\n  To address this issue, we propose PF2LoRA, a new personalized federated\nfine-tuning algorithm built on a novel \\emph{automatic rank learning approach\nvia two-level LoRA}.

Through extensive\nexperiments on contrastive learning tasks in NLP, computer vision, and graph\nlearning, we find that uniformly applying dropout across layers does not\nconsistently improve performance.

However, the\ntrade-off between self-supervision and pseudo-supervision can give rise to\nthree primary issues. The joint training causes Feature Randomness and Feature\nDrift, whereas the independent training causes Feature Randomness and Feature\nTwist. In essence, using pseudo-labels generates random and unreliable\nfeatures. The combination of pseudo-supervision and self-supervision drifts the\nreliable clustering-oriented features. Moreover, moving from self-supervision\nto pseudo-supervision can twist the curved latent manifolds. This paper\naddresses the limitations of existing deep clustering paradigms concerning\nFeature Randomness, Feature Drift, and Feature Twist. We propose a new paradigm\nwith a new strategy that replaces pseudo-supervision with a second round of\nself-supervision training. The new strategy makes the transition between\ninstance-level self-supervision and neighborhood-level self-supervision\nsmoother and less abrupt. Moreover, it prevents the drifting effect that is\ncaused by the strong competition between instance-level self-supervision and\nclustering-level pseudo-supervision.

Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and\nsevere occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to\nhandle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose\nestimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In\nthis work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for\nestimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our\napproach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a\nsequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency.\nFirst, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth\nambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify\nthe subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through\ncanonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then\nintroduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera\nviewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty\nand enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset\nas well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated\nusing the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging our\nnext-best-view strategy, our method achieves high object pose accuracy with\nsubstantially fewer viewpoints than heuristic-based policies.\n","authors":["Jun Yang","Wenjie Xue","Sahar Ghavidel","Steven L.

The primary challenge in becoming a fully reliable\nalternative lies in robust depth prediction capabilities, as camera-based\nsystems struggle with long detection ranges and adverse lighting and weather\nconditions. In this work, we introduce HyDRa, a novel camera-radar fusion\narchitecture for diverse 3D perception tasks. Building upon the principles of\ndense BEV (Bird's Eye View)-based architectures, HyDRa introduces a hybrid\nfusion approach to combine the strengths of complementary camera and radar\nfeatures in two distinct representation spaces. Our Height Association\nTransformer module leverages radar features already in the perspective view to\nproduce more robust and accurate depth predictions. In the BEV, we refine the\ninitial sparse representation by a Radar-weighted Depth Consistency. HyDRa\nachieves a new state-of-the-art for camera-radar fusion of 64.2 NDS (+1.8) and\n58.4 AMOTA (+1.5) on the public nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our new\nsemantically rich and spatially accurate BEV features can be directly converted\ninto a powerful occupancy representation, beating all previous camera-based\nmethods on the Occ3D benchmark by an impressive 3.7 mIoU.

This model integrates a hetero-modal encoder-decoder\nframework with the Vision XLSTM module to reconstruct missing MRI modalities.\nBy deeply fusing spatial and temporal features, it enhances tumor segmentation\nperformance. The key innovation of our approach is the Self-Attention\nVariational Encoder (SAVE) module, which improves the integration of modal\nfeatures. Additionally, it optimizes the interaction of features between\nsegmentation and reconstruction tasks through the Squeeze-Fusion-Excitation\nCross Awareness (SFECA) module.

While recent advancements have refined this technique, its performance is\nbottlenecked by the prevailing class-specific synthesis paradigm. Under this\nparadigm, synthetic data is optimized exclusively for a pre-assigned one-hot\nlabel, creating an implicit class barrier in feature condensation. This leads\nto inefficient utilization of the distillation budget and oversight of\ninter-class feature distributions, which ultimately limits the effectiveness\nand efficiency, as demonstrated in our analysis. To overcome these constraints,\nthis paper presents the Inter-class Feature Compensator (INFER), an innovative\ndistillation approach that transcends the class-specific data-label framework\nwidely utilized in current dataset distillation methods. Specifically, INFER\nleverages a Universal Feature Compensator (UFC) to enhance feature integration\nacross classes, enabling the generation of multiple additional synthetic\ninstances from a single UFC input. This significantly improves the efficiency\nof the distillation budget. Moreover, INFER enriches inter-class interactions\nduring the distillation, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of the distilled data. By allowing for the linear\ninterpolation of labels similar to those in the original dataset, INFER\nmeticulously optimizes the synthetic data and dramatically reduces the size of\nsoft labels in the synthetic dataset to almost zero, establishing a new\nbenchmark for efficiency and effectiveness in dataset distillation. In\npractice, INFER demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across benchmark\ndatasets.

In contrast, 2D poses are far more accessible and easier to\nobtain. Secondly, estimating a person's absolute position in metric space from\na single viewpoint is inherently more complex. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Mocap-2-to-3, a novel framework that decomposes intricate 3D motions\ninto 2D poses, leveraging 2D data to enhance 3D motion reconstruction in\ndiverse scenarios and accurately predict absolute positions in the world\ncoordinate system.

This approach improves existing SNN\ndistillation techniques by performing distillation learning on logits across\ndifferent time steps, rather than merely on aggregated output features.\nFurthermore, the integration of entropy regularization stabilizes model\noptimization and further boosts the performance. Extensive experimental results\nindicate that our method surpasses prior SNN distillation strategies, whether\nbased on logit distillation, feature distillation, or a combination of both.\nThe code will be available on GitHub.\n","authors":["Kairong Yu","Chengting Yu","Tianqing Zhang","Xiaochen Zhao","Shu Yang","Hongwei Wang","Qiang Zhang","Qi Xu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03144v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by CVPR 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03141v1","updated":"2025-03-05T03:31:05Z","published":"2025-03-05T03:31:05Z","title":"Implicit U-KAN2.0: Dynamic, Efficient and Interpretable Medical Image\n  Segmentation","summary":"  Image segmentation is a fundamental task in both image analysis and medical\napplications.

However, some patterns are catastrophically forgot\nduring adaptation and thus lead to poor performance in novel categories\nclassification. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning approach,\nLegoGCD, which is seamlessly integrated into previous methods to enhance the\ndiscrimination of novel classes while maintaining performance on previously\nencountered known classes.

Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET\noffers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs. Through a\ncomprehensive study of 59 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH do\nnot reliably predict downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in\nHELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlations with each other; and (3)\nwhile most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly\nlag behind closed ones when tasks require full-context reasoning or following\ncomplex instructions -- the gap widens as length increases. Finally, we\nrecommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to\nrun and better predict other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate\nfor a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.\n","authors":["Howard Yen","Tianyu Gao","Minmin Hou","Ke Ding","Daniel Fleischer","Peter Izsak","Moshe Wasserblat","Danqi Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02694v3.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2025.

Catching LLM Task Drift with Activation Deltas","summary":"  LLMs are commonly used in retrieval-augmented applications to execute user\ninstructions based on data from external sources. For example, modern search\nengines use LLMs to answer queries based on relevant search results; email\nplugins summarize emails by processing their content through an LLM. However,\nthe potentially untrusted provenance of these data sources can lead to prompt\ninjection attacks, where the LLM is manipulated by natural language\ninstructions embedded in the external data, causing it to deviate from the\nuser's original instruction(s). We define this deviation as task drift. Task\ndrift is a significant concern as it allows attackers to exfiltrate data or\ninfluence the LLM's output for other users. We study LLM activations as a\nsolution to detect task drift, showing that activation deltas - the difference\nin activations before and after processing external data - are strongly\ncorrelated with this phenomenon. Through two probing methods, we demonstrate\nthat a simple linear classifier can detect drift with near-perfect ROC AUC on\nan out-of-distribution test set. We evaluate these methods by making minimal\nassumptions about how users' tasks, system prompts, and attacks can be phrased.\nWe observe that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task\ndomains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions,\nwithout being trained on any of these attacks. Interestingly, the fact that\nthis solution does not require any modifications to the LLM (e.g.,\nfine-tuning), as well as its compatibility with existing meta-prompting\nsolutions, makes it cost-efficient and easy to deploy.

From the perspective of mechanism\ninterpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a\nboundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations.\nTherefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are\ninevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability.

To understand the impact of interventions\nprecisely, it is useful to examine \\emph{counterfactuals} -- e.g., how a given\nsentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a\nspecific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is\nconceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal\nhierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating\ntrue string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural\nequation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel\ncounterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint\ndistribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the\nsame instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on\nhindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables\nand generate counterfactuals of observed strings.

For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their\npretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for\nthree simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that\nare influential for answering factual questions.

Hence, this paper explores DoraemonGPT, a\ncomprehensive and conceptually elegant system driven by LLMs to understand\ndynamic scenes. Considering the video modality better reflects the\never-changing nature of real-world scenarios, we exemplify DoraemonGPT as a\nvideo agent. Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins by\nconverting the input video into a symbolic memory that stores task-related\nattributes.

The planner iteratively\nfinds feasible solutions by backpropagating the result's reward, and multiple\nsolutions can be summarized into an improved final answer.

It works by first employing a\ncompact model to draft multiple tokens efficiently and then using the target\nLLM to verify them in parallel. While this technique has achieved notable\nspeedups, most existing approaches necessitate either additional parameters or\nextensive training to construct effective draft models, thereby restricting\ntheir applicability across different LLMs and tasks. To address this\nlimitation, we explore a novel plug-and-play SD solution with layer-skipping,\nwhich skips intermediate layers of the target LLM as the compact draft model.\nOur analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit great potential for self-acceleration\nthrough layer sparsity and the task-specific nature of this sparsity. Building\non these insights, we introduce SWIFT, an on-the-fly self-speculative decoding\nalgorithm that adaptively selects intermediate layers of LLMs to skip during\ninference. SWIFT does not require auxiliary models or additional training,\nmaking it a plug-and-play solution for accelerating LLM inference across\ndiverse input data streams.

When visual stimuli are\nprocessed by human visual system into brain signals, some information is\ninevitably lost, leading to a discrepancy known as the \\textbf{System GAP}.\nAdditionally, perceptual and cognitive dynamics, along with technical noise in\nsignal acquisition, degrade the fidelity of brain signals relative to the\nvisual stimuli, known as the \\textbf{Random GAP}.

However, they perform poorly on the content and\nstyle images with the same semantics, i.e., the style of the corresponding\nsemantic region of the generated stylized image is inconsistent with that of\nthe style image. We argue that the root cause lies in their failure to consider\nthe relationship between local regions and semantic regions. To address this\nissue, we propose a plug-and-play semantic continuous-sparse attention, dubbed\nSCSA, for arbitrary semantic style transfer -- each query point considers\ncertain key points in the corresponding semantic region. Specifically, semantic\ncontinuous attention ensures each query point fully attends to all the\ncontinuous key points in the same semantic region that reflect the overall\nstyle characteristics of that region; Semantic sparse attention allows each\nquery point to focus on the most similar sparse key point in the same semantic\nregion that exhibits the specific stylistic texture of that region. By\ncombining the two modules, the resulting SCSA aligns the overall style of the\ncorresponding semantic regions while transferring the vivid textures of these\nregions. Qualitative and quantitative results prove that SCSA enables\nattention-based arbitrary style transfer methods to produce high-quality\nsemantic stylized images.\n","authors":["Chunnan Shang","Zhizhong Wang","Hongwei Wang","Xiangming Meng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04119v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by CVPR 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24185v2","updated":"2025-03-06T05:34:17Z","published":"2024-10-31T17:48:45Z","title":"DexMimicGen: Automated Data Generation for Bimanual Dexterous\n  Manipulation via Imitation Learning","summary":"  Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective means to teach\nrobots manipulation skills.

To address this, synthetic lesion generation has\nbecome a promising approach. However, existing models struggle with\nscalability, fine-grained control over lesion attributes, and the generation of\ncomplex structures. We propose LesionDiffusion, a text-controllable lesion\nsynthesis framework for 3D CT imaging that generates both lesions and\ncorresponding masks. By utilizing a structured lesion report template, our\nmodel provides greater control over lesion attributes and supports a wider\nvariety of lesion types. We introduce a dataset of 1,505 annotated CT scans\nwith paired lesion masks and structured reports, covering 14 lesion types\nacross 8 organs. LesionDiffusion consists of two components: a lesion mask\nsynthesis network (LMNet) and a lesion inpainting network (LINet), both guided\nby lesion attributes and image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLesionDiffusion significantly improves segmentation performance, with strong\ngeneralization to unseen lesion types and organs, outperforming current\nstate-of-the-art models.

In this work, we propose\nShazam, a novel framework designed to efficiently combine multiple CPath\nmodels.

To ensure that each FM contributes effectively without dominance, a novel\ndistillation strategy is applied, guiding the student model with features from\nall teacher models, which enhances its generalization ability. Experimental\nresults on two pathology patch classification datasets demonstrate that Shazam\noutperforms existing CPath models and other fusion methods.

However,\nexisting methods usually rely on global scene perception from pure 3D point\nclouds and overlook the importance of rich local texture details from\nmulti-view images. Moreover, due to the inherent noise in camera poses and\ncomplex occlusions, there exists significant feature degradation and reduced\nfeature robustness problems when aligning 3D point cloud with multi-view\nimages. In this paper, we propose a Dual-vision Scene Perception Network\n(DSPNet), to comprehensively integrate multi-view and point cloud features to\nimprove robustness in 3D QA. Our Text-guided Multi-view Fusion (TGMF) module\nprioritizes image views that closely match the semantic content of the text. To\nadaptively fuse back-projected multi-view images with point cloud features, we\ndesign the Adaptive Dual-vision Perception (ADVP) module, enhancing 3D scene\ncomprehension.

Even though automatic evaluation has been\nexplored in textual modality, the visual modality remains under-explored. As a\nresult, in this work, we address a question: \"Can LVLMs themselves be used to\nbenchmark each other in the visual automatically domain?\". We introduce\nAutoBench-V, an automated framework for serving evaluation on demand, i.e.,\nbenchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects of model capability. AutoBench-V\nleverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and then\nutilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completing\nthe evaluation process efficiently and flexibly.
